## My Wild Ride Through Nagaland Elections! 🤪🗳️

Hey everyone, Samdish here, and welcome back to another journey in our "Bharat Ek Khoj" series! 🇮🇳 This time, we left the plains behind and headed East to Nagaland during election season, and let me tell you, it was an experience like no other. It wasn't just about politics; it was about connecting with fellow citizens and seeing democracy in action in a truly unique way.

We found ourselves in a village in the Northern Angami 1 constituency, primarily inhabited by the Angami tribe.

### The Unique "Common Platform" ✨

Forget huge rallies and scattered speeches! In Nagaland, they have something called a "public platforma" or "common platform" during elections. It's described as an "evolved form of democratic practice" – candidates come and speak directly to *everyone* in the village gathered together!. It felt almost like a "school assembly", with a clear schedule including prayers by a pastor and special songs. Samdish noted that candidates even shook hands, implying they don't necessarily fight on this platform. It was described as "very well organized" and "peaceful". Apparently, for this specific village, this was the first time they were holding such a common platform!

### Life in the Village & The Big Issues 🤔

So, what's life like in this village, home to around 1800-2000 people?. Most residents are farmers, engaging in "Zoom cultivation" and growing rice. But beneath the peaceful surface, significant challenges persist.

When asked what they vote on, villagers emphasized that they support **"whoever works for the development of this Village"**. The most pressing issue? The **road to the village is "very bad"**, and they desperately want it developed.

Another major problem is **unemployment**, especially among the youth. Samdish spoke to a 37-year-old who was a graduate but currently unemployed.

And a fundamental need: **water**. One villager mentioned they have **no water supply** in their homes and have to buy it. Collecting water involves walking and having to "step down to collect the water and they have to climb up along with the water" every single day. That sounds incredibly tough! 😥

Villagers feel that politicians come, make promises when asking for votes, but don't listen or follow through once they win (using broader sources for context here).

### Meeting the People 👋

During the visit, Samdish interacted with various villagers. He met the unemployed graduate, an older gentleman who spoke about the water problems, and noted that people were generally quite shy. He specifically thanked everyone for being "so honest" about their situation.

### Samdish's Takeaway 🙏

For Samdish, experiencing this "common platform" was "overwhelming". He feels that being able to meet fellow citizens, understand their lives, and share their realities is "more valuable" to him than anything else. He hopes that by showing the "real truth", these videos will reach the authorities who can bring about positive change.

Visiting Nagaland during the elections was a powerful reminder of the core issues faced by many communities across India – the urgent need for basic infrastructure like roads and water, and the pervasive challenge of unemployment. It also highlighted a unique community-focused electoral process.
