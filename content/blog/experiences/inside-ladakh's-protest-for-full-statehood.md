## Standing Strong for the Himalayas: Inside Ladakh's Fight for Statehood & 6th Schedule 🙏🏔️❄️

Hey everyone, Samdish here! 👋 On our journey across India for 'Bharat Ek Khoj', we witnessed something truly powerful in Ladakh. We spent time understanding a major protest led by climate activist Sonam Wangchuk, where the people of Ladakh are raising their voices for their future and their land.

The core demands are **Statehood and the implementation of the 6th Schedule of the Constitution**.

### What is the 6th Schedule and Why Does Ladakh Want It? 🤔

The 6th Schedule provides for **autonomous councils of elected representatives** for indigenous tribal people. These are described as **"small parliaments"** where local people can decide how their mountains and land should be managed. The argument is that **people from Ladakh** know best how to manage this unique place, thinking about **future generations**, not just the present.

Currently, Ladakh is governed as a Union Territory by a bureaucrat or a lieutenant governor who is there for only three or four years. This way of governance is felt to be like being governed **"like a colony"**. Locals believe that officials who don't understand the place will inevitably make mistakes.

Granting 6th Schedule status would mean that any land acquisition would require **consultation with the local people**. Without safeguards, locals, particularly farmers and shepherds, fear **losing their pasture lands** to corporates and industries. The famous Pashmina goat shepherds, especially those near the Chinese border to the east, are losing land. To the south, land is being lost to corporates.

The fear is that Ladakh could become like **Joshimath**, which has seen destruction due to mining and industrialisation harming the ecosystem. The people believe **"precaution is better than cure"**.

### Broken Promises and Lack of Action 😟

The protest is happening about 3-4 years after Ladakh was established as a Union Territory. Villagers feel that the government has been **making promises but not delivering**. Before the LHDC elections, the Home Minister himself reportedly stated that Ladakh would be granted 6th Schedule status in 15 days. However, after the elections were won, **nothing was done**.

Subsequently, protests led to the formation of a high-powered committee, but again, nothing further happened. Another meeting called by the MHA also led nowhere, except for a sub-committee being formed. Ultimately, before the Model Code of Conduct came into effect, the government **"clearly denied that Ladakh will not be granted with 6th schedule"**. Some feel the government **"played with the people here very cleverly"** by delaying the decision until the Model Code of Conduct was in place.

### Other Major Concerns 😥

Beyond protecting land and culture, the people are also protesting against **rising unemployment**. Since Ladakh became a Union Territory, there hasn't been a **single opening for a gazetted post**. Educated youth are struggling to find jobs.

Locals feel that their UT is **"not operated by the leaders of Kargil or Leh"** but is run by the Centre, feeling controlled from afar. This highlights the demand for **Statehood**, which would provide a legislative assembly and control over the major chunk of the budget. Misuse of this budget without local control could lead to resentment, which is considered **"never good for the country's security"** in such a sensitive border area.

Some people also feel that since becoming a UT, Ladakh is **"in danger"** and that people want to take away their land. While acknowledging some development has occurred, locals strongly feel they should have the **right to protect their culture and have safeguards**.

### The Nature of the Protest and Voices Heard 🗣️🎤

The protest in Ladakh, as shown, involves significant numbers of people. Over 21 days, between **40,000 to 60,000 people came** to show support, with 2,000 to 3,000 attending daily.

The protest is framed as a fight for **"democratic values,"** against oppression, and importantly, to **"save climate"**. It's argued that the issue is not just about Ladakh; if Ladakh's ecosystem is damaged, it could impact the whole of North India, particularly regarding water resources from the Himalayas.

There is a strong feeling that in a democracy, the government **"should be sensitive to what people want"**. This is seen as a democratic right, not a request for charity. Some citizens express that 99.9% of the people are with the Apex Body leading the protest. Even a 99-year-old resident voiced that they haven't seen a government official working properly for the people, apart from protecting their own positions.

### Media Coverage and Hope 🙏📰

Samdish notes that while the mainstream media seems **"blatantly compromised,"** which he calls a **"very, very sad thing for a democracy,"** the hope lies with citizens who have become journalists themselves and are spreading information. He expresses hope that media channels will eventually let their conscience guide them if they are true journalists and not just businessmen.

Despite feeling handicapped and having their right to speech taken away, the people of Ladakh are determined to support their cause.

### A Call for Awareness 📣

Samdish's visit aimed to highlight the reality of the situation in Ladakh. The protestors urge everyone to support this cause, viewing it as a larger crisis about saving the Himalayas and ensuring a dignified life based on constitutional ideals.

The video encourages viewers to share it widely so that the voices and problems of the people of Ladakh can reach the authorities who can make a change.
