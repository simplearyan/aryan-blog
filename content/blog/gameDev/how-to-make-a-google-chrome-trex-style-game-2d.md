Creating a Chrome T-Rex style endless runner in Godot involves implementing several core game systems that work together to create the classic side-scrolling experience [^2]. This comprehensive guide will walk you through building all the essential components, from player physics to obstacle spawning and background scrolling.

Chrome T-Rex style side-scrolling game with a dinosaur jumping over cacti obstacles

## Game Overview and Core Mechanics

The Chrome Dinosaur Game is an endless runner where the player controls a pixelated T-Rex that continuously moves from left to right across a desert landscape [^32]. The gameplay revolves around avoiding oncoming obstacles such as cacti and pterosaurs by jumping or ducking [^32]. The game gradually increases in speed until the player hits an obstacle, triggering an instant game over [^32].

The core mechanics include gravity-based jumping physics, collision detection with obstacles, parallax background scrolling, and progressive difficulty scaling [^2]. In Godot, this translates to using CharacterBody2D for player movement, Area2D nodes for obstacle detection, and ParallaxBackground for the scrolling environment [^8][^17].

## Project Setup and Scene Structure

Begin by creating a new Godot project and setting up the main scene structure [^1]. The recommended node hierarchy follows a modular approach that separates different game systems for better organization and maintainability [^2].

The main scene should contain a Node2D as the root, with child nodes including the Player (CharacterBody2D), Background (ParallaxBackground), Ground (StaticBody2D), ObstacleSpawner (Node2D), and UI (CanvasLayer) [^1][^8]. This structure allows each system to operate independently while communicating through Godot's signal system and node groups [^8].

Configure the project settings to handle pixel art properly by setting the texture import filter to "Off" for crisp pixel graphics [^1]. Set up input actions for "jump" (Space/Up Arrow) and "duck" (Down Arrow) in the Input Map section of Project Settings [^1][^2].

## Player Character Implementation

The player character uses CharacterBody2D for precise movement control and collision handling [^8]. CharacterBody2D is ideal for character controllers because it provides built-in methods like `move_and_slide()` and `is_on_floor()` while allowing complete control over physics behavior [^8][^10].

The player script implements gravity-based physics where velocity increases downward over time until the character hits the ground [^13]. Jump mechanics use a fixed velocity applied upward when the jump input is pressed, but only while on the ground to prevent infinite jumping [^8][^13]. The ducking mechanic adjusts the collision shape dynamically and can provide faster falling when pressed mid-air [^2].

Animation state management switches between idle, running, jumping, ducking, and death animations based on player state and input [^1][^9]. The collision system uses layer 1 for the player and layer 2 for obstacles, with appropriate masks set for detection [^24][^8].

## Obstacle System and Spawning

The obstacle system consists of two main components: individual obstacle scenes and a spawner that manages their creation and timing [^2][^14]. Each obstacle extends Area2D for collision detection without physical collision response, allowing the player to pass through while triggering game over events [^24].

Obstacles move from right to left at a speed that increases over time, creating progressive difficulty [^2][^21]. The spawner uses a Timer node to create obstacles at random intervals, with spawn timing becoming more frequent as the game progresses [^14]. Different obstacle types (ground-based cacti and flying pterodactyls) can be randomly selected from an array of preloaded scenes [^2].

The collision detection system uses the `body_entered` signal from Area2D to detect when the player character enters an obstacle's collision area [^24][^30]. When a collision occurs, the obstacle calls the player's `die()` method, which triggers the game over sequence [^2].

## Background and Parallax Scrolling

The parallax background system creates depth illusion by moving multiple layers at different speeds [^16][^17][^19]. ParallaxBackground serves as the container node, with ParallaxLayer children containing Sprite2D nodes for different visual elements [^17][^20].

Each layer has different motion_scale values: distant elements like sky and clouds move slowly (0.1-0.3), middle elements like hills move at medium speed (0.5), and foreground elements like ground move at full speed (1.0) [^19][^23]. The motion_mirroring property enables seamless infinite scrolling by automatically repeating textures when they move off-screen [^19].

The background can scroll automatically without camera movement by modifying the scroll_offset property in a script attached to the ParallaxBackground node [^18][^20]. Day and night cycles can be implemented by changing the modulate color of sprite layers at regular intervals [^2].

## Game State Management

A centralized GameManager handles all game states including start, running, game over, and restart phases [^28][^2]. This manager coordinates between all game systems using Godot's group system and signals for clean communication [^8].

The scoring system uses a Timer that increments the score at regular intervals while the game is running [^29]. High scores are saved to a file using Godot's FileAccess class for persistence between sessions [^2]. Game state transitions are triggered by input events and collision detection, with proper cleanup of obstacles and player state reset during restarts [^31].

Visual feedback includes score display, high score tracking, game over messages, and start instructions through a UI system built with CanvasLayer and Control nodes [^29]. Sound effects for jumping and game over events enhance the player experience [^2].

## Physics and Movement Refinement

Fine-tuning the physics requires balancing gravity strength, jump velocity, and game speed for satisfying gameplay [^13][^15]. The gravity value should feel substantial enough to create weight but not so strong that jumps feel floaty or uncontrollable [^13]. Jump height and time can be calculated mathematically using projectile motion formulas for precise control [^13].

Variable jump heights can be implemented by allowing the player to control jump duration through input timing [^13]. Coyote time (brief grace period for jumping after leaving a platform) and jump buffering (allowing jump input slightly before landing) improve the game feel significantly [^5].

The ground collision uses StaticBody2D with CollisionShape2D to create solid surfaces that interact properly with the CharacterBody2D player [^8][^11]. Collision layers and masks must be configured correctly to ensure proper interaction between player, obstacles, and environment [^25][^26].

## Advanced Features and Polish

Progressive difficulty scaling adjusts spawn rates, obstacle speeds, and variety over time to maintain engagement [^2][^21]. The original Chrome game switches between day and night modes every 700 points, which can be replicated through background color modulation [^32].

Object pooling can optimize performance by reusing obstacle instances instead of constantly creating and destroying them [^22]. This becomes important as game speed increases and obstacles spawn more frequently [^21].

Visual effects like screen shake on collision, particle effects for dust clouds, and smooth camera following enhance the polish level [^1]. Sound design with jumping sounds, collision effects, and ambient background audio creates a more immersive experience [^2].

## Testing and Optimization

Playtesting reveals balance issues with jump timing, obstacle spacing, and difficulty progression [^2]. The game should feel challenging but fair, with obstacles spaced appropriately for the current movement speed [^21]. Performance optimization focuses on efficient sprite rendering, minimal garbage collection from object creation, and smooth frame rate maintenance [^22].

Mobile adaptation requires touch input handling for jump and duck actions, with visual touch indicators for better usability [^32]. Screen scaling considerations ensure the game works across different device resolutions while maintaining pixel-perfect rendering [^1].

## Conclusion

Building a Chrome T-Rex style side scroller in Godot demonstrates many fundamental game development concepts including physics-based character controllers, procedural content generation, state management, and performance optimization [^8][^2]. The modular approach using separate scenes for different game components creates maintainable code that can be easily extended with new features [^1].

The key to success lies in iterative development, starting with basic movement and collision detection, then gradually adding features like scoring, background scrolling, and visual polish [^2][^21]. Godot's node-based architecture and built-in physics systems provide excellent tools for this type of game, making it an ideal project for learning game development fundamentals [^8][^1].
