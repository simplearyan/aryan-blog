## Summary of "Bholi"

The story is about **Sulekha**, nicknamed **Bholi**, meaning simpleton, because she was a backward child after falling on her head at ten months old. At two years old, she had small-pox, leaving her body permanently disfigured by deep black pock-marks, though her eyes were saved. She could not speak until she was five and then **stammered**, leading other children to make fun of her. Born into a prosperous farmer's family as the youngest of seven children (three sons and four daughters), she was **neglected at home**. Her father, Ramlal, a Numberdar, was worried about her lack of good looks and intelligence, which made finding a husband difficult.

When a primary school for girls opened in their village, the Tehsildar sahib insisted Ramlal send his daughters to set an example. Ramlal's wife initially opposed it, fearing it would affect their daughters' marriage prospects, but suggested sending Bholi, as there was little chance of her getting married anyway.

Bholi was initially frightened to go to school, thinking she might be sold like their old cow. However, being given a clean dress, bathed, and having oil rubbed into her hair made her feel she was going to a better place. At school, she was glad to see other girls her age, hoping for a friend. Her **teacher** was kind and encouraging. When Bholi stammered while saying her name, the teacher's soft voice touched her heart and encouraged her to speak, helping her overcome her stammer and feel a sense of achievement. The teacher promised her she would be more learned than anyone in the village and people would listen to her with respect if she came to school every day. Bholi left with a new hope and life.

Years passed, the village grew, and Bholi's school became a high school. Ramlal received a marriage proposal for Bholi from **Bishamber Nath**, a well-to-do grocer from another village. Although Bishamber was much older, limped, and had grown-up children, her parents accepted because he was wealthy, not asking for dowry, and was unaware of her pock-marks and perceived lack of sense. Bholi overheard this conversation and was described as being like a "dumb cow" by her mother.

On the wedding day, Bishamber saw Bholi's pock-marks and demanded a dowry of five thousand rupees. Ramlal begged and offered two thousand, but Bishamber was insistent. Ramlal had to pay the five thousand. Bishamber was triumphant and went to garland Bholi. At this moment, Bholi looked straight at him with **cold contempt**. She struck out, flung the garland into the fire, and threw off her veil.

Speaking in a clear, loud voice without any stammer, she told her father to take back the money, declaring she would not marry Bishamber. Despite her father's and neighbours' shock and accusations of being shameless and crazy, Bholi stood firm. She told them she was willing to marry the old man for their family's honour ("izzat"), but she would not marry a "mean, greedy and contemptible coward". She stated that the "dumb-driven cow, the stammering fool," was speaking now. Bishamber's party left.

Distraught, Ramlal worried about what would happen to her now, as no one would marry her. Bholi, in a calm and steady voice, promised to serve her parents in their old age and teach in the same school where she learned so much. Her teacher, who had been observing, confirmed Bholi's words with deep satisfaction, like an artist completing a masterpiece.

**Questions and Answers**

Here are the questions from the chapter and their answers, drawn directly from the sources provided:

**READ AND FIND OUT**

*   **Why is Bholi’s father worried about her?** 🤔👨‍👧
    Bholi's father, Ramlal, is worried about her because she had **neither good looks nor intelligence**. This made it difficult to find a bridegroom for her.
*   **For what unusual reasons is Bholi sent to school?** 🤔🏫
    Bholi is sent to school for unusual reasons. The Tehsildar sahib, a revenue official, asked Ramlal to send his daughters to school to set an example for the villagers. However, Ramlal's wife suggested sending Bholi because there was **little chance of her getting married anyway** due to her "ugly face and lack of sense," so the teachers could worry about her.
*   **Does Bholi enjoy her first day at school?** 😊😟
    Bholi was initially frightened, but she felt she was going to a better place after being cleaned and dressed. At school, she was **glad to find so many girls almost of her own age** and hoped one might become her friend. Although she couldn't understand what the teacher was saying at first and cried when she stammered, her teacher's kind voice and encouragement made her feel better. So, while parts were difficult, finding age-mates and the teacher's kindness made it a positive experience compared to home.
*   **Does she find her teacher different from the people at home?** ✨👩‍🏫
    Yes, she finds her teacher **very different** from the people at home. The teacher's voice was **soft and soothing**, and she had never been called like that in her life. The teacher encouraged her and didn't laugh at her stammer. People at home often neglected Bholi, made fun of her, and called her names like "fool" or "dumb cow".
*   **Why do Bholi’s parents accept Bishamber’s marriage proposal?** 🤔💰👨‍👧
    Bholi's parents accept Bishamber's marriage proposal because he was a **well-to-do grocer** with a big shop, a house, and money in the bank, and he was **not asking for any dowry** initially. They also considered themselves lucky that he was from another village and did not know about Bholi's pock-marks and perceived lack of sense, believing that if they didn't accept, she might remain unmarried.
*   **Why does the marriage not take place?** 💔😠
    The marriage does not take place because Bishamber Nath, upon seeing Bholi's pock-marks after the veil was lifted, **demanded a dowry of five thousand rupees**. Ramlal paid the money, but when Bishamber went to garland her, Bholi **refused to marry him**. She called him a "mean, greedy and contemptible coward" and stated she would not marry him.

**Think About It**

*   **Bholi had many apprehensions about going to school. What made her feel that she was going to a better place than her home?** 🙏✨
    Bholi felt she was going to a better place than her home when she was given a **clean dress** (unlike the old ones passed down from her sisters) and was **bathed and had oil rubbed into her dry, matted hair**. This attention made her begin to believe that she was being taken to a place "better than her home".
*   **How did Bholi’s teacher play an important role in changing the course of her life?** 👩‍🏫💖
    Bholi's teacher played a **crucial role** in changing her life. The teacher was kind, with a "soft and soothing" voice, and did not laugh at Bholi's stammer. She **encouraged Bholi to speak** and overcome her stammer, making her feel a sense of achievement. The teacher promised her future success through education – being able to read, becoming learned, gaining respect, and speaking without stammering. This encouragement gave Bholi a **"new hope and a new life"** and the confidence to eventually stand up for herself and refuse the greedy groom.
*   **Why did Bholi at first agree to an unequal match? Why did she later reject the marriage? What does this tell us about her?** 🤔💔🌟
    Bholi at first agreed to the unequal match with Bishamber Nath because her parents arranged it, and she was told by her mother that she was like a "dumb cow" and should accept the proposal. She was willing to marry the "lame old man" for the sake of her father's honour ("izzat").
    She later rejected the marriage because Bishamber Nath, a "mean, greedy and contemptible coward," demanded a huge dowry upon seeing her pock-marks.
    This tells us that Bholi was initially **submissive and willing to sacrifice her own happiness** for her family's honour. However, after her education and the teacher's influence gave her confidence and self-respect, she could **stand up for herself** and recognize her self-worth, refusing to be married to a man who treated her and her family with greed and contempt. It shows her transformation from a "simpleton" and "dumb cow" into a strong, self-respecting woman.
*   **Bholi’s real name is Sulekha. We are told this right at the beginning. But only in the last but one paragraph of the story is Bholi called Sulekha again. Why do you think she is called Sulekha at that point in the story?** ✨ Sulekha ✨
    Bholi's real name, Sulekha, is used again at the end of the story to signify her **transformation and growth**. "Bholi" means simpleton and was a nickname given to her due to her perceived lack of intelligence and her stammer. By standing up for herself, speaking clearly without stammering, and making a promise to serve her parents and teach, she shows she is no longer the simpleton she once was. The use of her birth name, Sulekha, marks her **emergence as a strong, intelligent, and capable individual**, someone who has shed the limitations implied by the nickname Bholi.

**Talk About It**

*   **Bholi’s story must have moved you. Do you think girl children are not treated at par with boys? You are aware that the government has introduced a scheme to save the girl child as the sex ratio is declining. The scheme is called Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Save the Girl Child. Read about the scheme and design a poster in groups of four and display on the school notice board.** 🤔👧👦💖 (This is a question for reflection, research, and a creative task, based on the story's theme of unequal treatment of girls).
*   **Bholi’s teacher helped her overcome social barriers by encouraging and motivating her. How do you think you can contribute towards changing the social attitudes illustrated in this story?** 🙏👩‍🏫💡 (This is a question for personal reflection and discussion about social change).
*   **Should girls be aware of their rights, and assert them? Should girls and boys have the same rights, duties and privileges? What are some of the ways in which society treats them differently? When we speak of ‘human rights’, do we differentiate between girls’ rights and boys’ rights?** ✨ igualdad ✨ (This is a question for discussion about rights, equality, and societal differences in treatment).
*   **Do you think the characters in the story were speaking to each other in English? If not, in which language were they speaking? (You can get clues from the names of the persons and the non-English words used in the story.)** 🤔🗣️🗺️
    The sources present the dialogue in English. However, clues suggest the characters are likely speaking a language common in the region where the story is set, likely Hindi or Punjabi, given the names and terms used. Names like Ramlal, Bishamber Nath, Sulekha (Bholi), Radha, Mangla, Champa, and terms like "Numberdar", "Tehsildar sahib", "Pitaji", "izzat", and "Ma'am" (used by Bholi for her teacher) are indicative of an Indian setting. The dialogue is translated into English for the reader.

These are questions intended for discussion and do not have specific answers provided in the sources, except for clues regarding the likely language spoken.
