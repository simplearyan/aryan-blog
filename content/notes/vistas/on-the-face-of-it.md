### Summary of "On the Face of It" 🌿🧍‍♂️👦

"On the Face of It" is a play about an unlikely friendship that blossoms between an **old man, Mr Lamb**, and a **young boy, Derry**. The story begins with Derry secretly entering Mr Lamb’s garden, believing it to be empty. He is startled when Mr Lamb speaks to him.

Derry has a face that was **burned by acid**, leaving him disfigured. Because of this, he is very self-conscious and withdrawn, believing that everyone is afraid of him or pities him, and he even fears his own reflection. He feels alienated and doesn't like being around people who stare.

Mr Lamb, on the other hand, is an **old man with a tin leg** that was blown off in the war. Despite his own disability and the fact that children sometimes call him "Lamey-Lamb", he is **open-hearted, optimistic, and welcoming**. He has a unique philosophy of life: he sees beauty and value in everything, from crab apples to weeds, and believes that physical differences are not important. He tells Derry that "Beauty and the Beast" stories are about what's inside, not outside, and encourages him to think beyond his appearance. Mr Lamb keeps his gate always open and has many friends, including children who come for apples and toffee.

Mr Lamb's gentle yet direct approach slowly breaks through Derry's shell. He tells Derry that he has "two arms, two legs and eyes and ears, you’ve got a tongue and a brain" and can "get on the way you want". He also shares a story about a man who locked himself away out of fear of the world, only to be killed by a falling picture, implying that isolation isn't a solution.

Inspired by Mr Lamb's words and the peaceful atmosphere of the garden, Derry decides to **return** after going home to tell his mother. His mother is worried and tries to prevent him, having heard "things" about Mr Lamb. However, Derry insists on going back, stating he "hate[s] it here" (at home) and wants to listen to Mr Lamb and the bees.

When Derry finally rushes back to the garden, filled with new hope, he finds **Mr Lamb has fallen from a ladder** while trying to pick crab apples, and is dead. The play ends with Derry weeping, marking a tragic but transformative moment, as his brief association with Mr Lamb has profoundly changed his outlook and courage.

### Answers to Questions ❓

1.  **What is it that draws Derry towards Mr Lamb in spite of himself?** 🧲❤️
    Derry is drawn to Mr Lamb for several key reasons, despite his initial reluctance and fear of people:
    *   **Unconditional Acceptance and Non-Judgment** 🙏: Unlike others who stare, pity, or are afraid of his burned face, Mr Lamb treats Derry as an ordinary boy. He doesn't flinch or react with fear or disgust. He asks Derry to help him pick crab apples, treating him normally.
    *   **Unique and Positive Perspective on Life** 🌳🐝: Mr Lamb’s philosophy is deeply appealing. He sees life and beauty in everything, even what others call "weeds". He emphasizes that differences like a burned face or a tin leg are "Not important". He helps Derry understand that inner qualities are more significant than outward appearance, using the "Beauty and the Beast" analogy.
    *   **Encouragement and Empowerment** 💪: Mr Lamb inspires Derry to stop focusing on his disability and instead recognize his capabilities. He reminds Derry that he has "two arms, two legs and eyes and ears, you’ve got a tongue and a brain" and can "get on the way you want". He challenges Derry's self-imposed isolation by telling the story of the man who locked himself away.
    *   **Openness and Hospitality** 🏡🤝: Mr Lamb's garden gate is "always open," symbolising his welcoming nature. He tells Derry that "Everything’s yours if you want it", providing a sense of belonging that Derry lacks elsewhere. He considers Derry a friend instantly, without needing to know his full identity.
    *   **Meaningful Conversation** 🗣️💡: Derry explicitly states that Mr Lamb talks about "Things that matter. Things nobody else has ever said. Things I want to think about". This intellectual and emotional engagement is a significant draw, offering Derry a perspective beyond his own insecurities.

2.  **In which section of the play does Mr Lamb display signs of loneliness and disappointment? What are the ways in which Mr Lamb tries to overcome these feelings?** 😔💔
    Mr Lamb reveals his loneliness and disappointment subtly, primarily at the end of Scene One:
    *   **Signs of Loneliness and Disappointment**:
        *   When Derry asks if Mr Lamb has any friends, Mr Lamb replies, "Hundreds". However, in the very final lines of Scene One, after Derry has left promising to return, Mr Lamb says to himself: "I’ll come back. **They never do, though. Not them. Never do come back.**". This poignant remark, spoken in solitude, directly reveals his past experiences of people not returning and his underlying disappointment. It shows that despite his outward optimism, he carries the burden of unfulfilled connections.
    *   **Ways Mr Lamb Tries to Overcome These Feelings**:
        *   **Maintaining Openness and Inclusivity** 🚪👐: Mr Lamb actively combats loneliness by keeping his garden gate "always open". He welcomes "anybody" into his garden, regardless of who they are, encouraging visitors and company. This constant openness is a deliberate effort to attract human connection.
        *   **Engagement with the World and Nature** 🌍🌻: He finds joy and company in his surroundings. He sits in the sun, reads books, makes jelly from crab apples, makes toffee with honey for the children, and finds pleasure in the "humming" (singing) of his bees. He appreciates the light, darkness, and the wind through his open windows. By engaging with the small details of life and nature, he fills his days and counters isolation.
        *   **Philosophical Outlook and Mentorship** 🧠💡: Mr Lamb actively seeks to understand and connect with others through conversation. He asks questions and likes to learn. He shares his profound insights, guiding people like Derry to see beyond their physical limitations and societal prejudices. His desire to impart wisdom and help others live fuller lives is a way of creating meaningful connections and perhaps finding purpose beyond his solitary existence.

3.  **The actual pain or inconvenience caused by a physical impairment is often much less than the sense of alienation felt by the person with disabilities. What is the kind of behaviour that the person expects from others?** 🎭😢
    The play vividly portrays Derry's deep sense of **alienation** due to his burned face, which significantly overshadows any physical pain:
    *   Derry explicitly states, "People are afraid of me". He perceives that others look at his face and think, "That’s bad. That’s a terrible thing. That’s the ugliest thing I ever saw".
    *   He feels others "pretend it isn’t true and isn’t there", or they "stare". He even feels his own mother kisses him on the "other side of my face" because she "has to".
    *   He overhears people talking about him, wondering, "How ever will he get on in this world? Looking like that? With that on his face?".
    *   He mentions a common sentiment that people with disabilities should be with "others like himself", highlighting the societal pressure for segregation.
    *   He hates being near people because they stare or are afraid. He feels people are "just....nothing" if they don't engage with him genuinely.

    Based on this, the **kind of behaviour a person with disabilities expects or desires from others** (and what Mr Lamb exemplifies) includes:
    *   **Genuine Acceptance and Normalisation** 😊: They want to be seen as individuals, not defined solely by their disability. They desire to be treated normally, without pity, fear, or forced sympathy. Mr Lamb talks to Derry about picking apples and making jelly, as if his face is irrelevant to their interaction.
    *   **Looking Beyond Physical Appearance** 👁️‍🗨️: They hope others will look past their visible impairments to their inner qualities and capabilities. Mr Lamb tells Derry that he has a brain and can achieve things.
    *   **Respect and Non-Staring** 🚫👀: They seek to avoid being made an object of curiosity or fear through prolonged staring or open expressions of disgust.
    *   **Inclusion and Friendship** 🫂: They wish for inclusion in society and the opportunity for genuine friendship, without being judged or isolated. Mr Lamb immediately accepts Derry as a friend.
    *   **Focus on Abilities, Not Limitations** 💪: They want others to acknowledge their potential and encourage their independence, rather than focusing on what they *cannot* do.

4.  **Will Derry get back to his old seclusion or will Mr Lamb’s brief association effect a change in the kind of life he will lead in the future?** 🦋🚀
    Based on the sources, **Derry will NOT get back to his old seclusion**; Mr Lamb's brief association **does effect a significant and transformative change** in the kind of life he will lead in the future.
    *   **Defiance of Past Patterns** 🏃‍♂️💨: Derry explicitly breaks his pattern of withdrawal and fear. He runs "three miles" to return to Mr Lamb's garden, despite his mother's objections and warnings. This act of returning is a powerful testament to his newfound courage and determination to overcome his fears and the negativity of others.
    *   **Shift in Perspective and Desires** 🌟🧠: Derry articulates his newfound desire to be in Mr Lamb's garden, listen to the bees, and engage with "Things that matter. Things nobody else has ever said. Things I want to think about". This shows a profound shift from his previous preoccupation with his physical appearance and isolation. He expresses hatred for his home environment ("I hate it here") in contrast to his liking for Mr Lamb's garden.
    *   **Embracing Risk and Connection** 🤝💔: The fact that Derry makes the effort to return, knowing his mother's disapproval, indicates a willingness to take risks for human connection and self-growth. His intense emotional reaction—weeping and repeating "I came back" upon finding Mr Lamb dead—shows that the connection was real and deeply impactful. This raw grief signifies that he has moved beyond his self-imposed emotional detachment.
    *   **Breaking the Cycle of Seclusion** 🔄➡️: Although the play ends tragically with Mr Lamb's death, the influence he had on Derry is cemented by Derry's actions. Mr Lamb's earlier thought, "They never do, though. Not them. Never do come back", is directly contradicted by Derry's return. This suggests that Mr Lamb's legacy is in having finally reached someone and enabled them to break free from self-imprisonment. Derry's brief but intense experience with Mr Lamb has instilled in him the confidence and desire to seek out connection and life, rather than retreating into isolation.
