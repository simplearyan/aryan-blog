This chapter features **two different stories about flying**.

### Summary of 'Two Stories about Flying'

**Part I: His First Flight**

This story is about a **young seagull** who is **afraid to fly**. He is left alone on his ledge while his family has already flown away. He feels certain his wings will never support him. His parents call to him, scolding and threatening him to starve unless he flies away.

The young seagull is **maddened by the sight of food**. His mother flies towards him with a piece of fish but stops just within his reach. Driven by hunger, he **dives at the fish**. With a loud scream, he falls outwards and downwards into space. He is initially seized by terror, but then his wings spread outwards, and he feels the wind. He starts soaring and is no longer afraid. His family joins him, flying around him and screaming. He eventually lands on the green sea, where his legs sink initially, causing fright, but then he floats. His family praises him and offers him food. He has finally made his first flight.

**Part II: The Black Aeroplane**

This story is told by a **pilot** flying his old **Dakota aeroplane** from France back to England. He is happy and dreaming of his holiday. The sky is clear, with the moon and stars shining. Suddenly, he sees **huge black storm clouds**. He decides to **take the risk** and fly into the storm.

Inside the clouds, it becomes completely black, and he can see nothing. His old compass is dead, and other instruments stop working. He is lost in the storm. Then, he sees another **black aeroplane** with no lights on its wings. The pilot in this strange plane waves and signals him to **follow**. He follows obediently, even though he only has fuel left for five or ten minutes. The black aeroplane starts to go down, and he follows it out of the storm.

He lands safely. When he asks the woman in the control centre about the other aeroplane, she looks at him strangely. She tells him his was the only plane on the radar that night. The narrator is left wondering who the pilot was who helped him.
