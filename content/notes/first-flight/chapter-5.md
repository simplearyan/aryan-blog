**Summary of "Glimpses of India"**

The "Glimpses of India" chapter gives a picture of three different regions of India, showing how varied, charming, and beautiful the country is. It aims to provide rich, comprehensible inputs to learners and includes texts in a variety of genres, touching upon aspects of life relevant to adolescents, including glimpses of our country and our relationship with the natural world.

1.  **A Baker from Goa**: This section looks back at the **traditional bakers of Goa** from the old Portuguese days. Elders are often nostalgic about this time and the famous loaves of bread. While the people who ate those loaves might be gone, the mixers, moulders, and bakers still exist, and the age-old, time-tested furnaces are still used. The traditional baker's arrival in the morning is announced by the thud and jingle of his bamboo. Bakers were very important for the village, as bread was essential for marriage gifts (the sweet bread called 'bol'), parties, feasts, and even for Christmas with cakes and bolinhas. The baker's monthly accounts were recorded on a wall with a pencil. The baker and his family were generally happy and prosperous and had a plump physique, which was an open testimony to this. The son often carries on the family profession.

2.  **Coorg**: Coorg, or Kodagu, is described as a **piece of heaven** midway between Mysore and Mangalore, a land of rolling hills inhabited by martial men, beautiful women, and wild creatures. It is the smallest district of Karnataka and is famous for its evergreen rainforests (covering thirty per cent of the district), spices, and coffee plantations. The season for visitors is from September to March, as it pours heavily during the monsoons. The people of Coorg are known as Kodavu people. They are believed to be of Arab descent, supported by the tradition of wearing a long coat with an embroidered waist-belt called a Kuppia. Coorg offers various adventure sports like river rafting, canoeing, rappelling, rock climbing, and mountain biking, as well as numerous walking trails. Visitors can see birds, bees, butterflies, macaques, Malabar squirrels, langurs, slender loris, and wild elephants. Climbing the Brahmagiri hills offers a panoramic view of the misty landscape. Nearby is India's largest Tibetan settlement at Bylakuppe, where Buddhist monks in red, ochre, and yellow robes can be seen.

3.  **Tea from Assam**: This part introduces Rajvir, a classmate of Pranjol from Assam, who visits Pranjol's home during summer vacation. It describes the **vast tea gardens of Assam**, where green, green scenery stretches as far as the eye can see, with tiny tea plants dwarfed by tall shade-trees and doll-like figures moving among the rows. Tea is very popular, with over eighty crore cups drunk daily worldwide. Two legends about the discovery of tea are mentioned: one about a Chinese emperor who accidentally discovered it when tea leaves fell into his boiling water, and another about an ancient Buddhist ascetic named Bodhidharma who cut off his eyelids, from which ten tea plants grew, whose leaves banished sleep when put in hot water and drunk. Tea was first drunk in China around 2700 B.C., and words like 'tea', 'chai', and 'chini' are from Chinese. It came to Europe in the sixteenth century and was initially drunk as medicine. The text mentions the "second-flush or sprouting period" of tea cultivation, which lasts from May to July and yields the best tea.

These sections introduce students to different geographical locations, cultures, and practices in India.

        *   (ii) Rakesh will **undergo** major surgery tomorrow morning. 🏥
        *   (iii) My brother is responsible for the **breakdown** of our family property. (Note: The source suggests "break" combined with words like over, by, through, out, up, down. "breakdown" fits the context, although the source specifically lists examples like "throw over", "breakthrough", "pass by", "lookout", "cast down". The provided answer key for this exercise in the source is not visible, so this answer is based on typical English usage and the provided options.) 📉

"job" is not in the list, but the sentence structure suggests a type of interview. Without the complete list of provided words from the source's implied question, I will use "interview" as given, fitting the blank in the sentence). 🏢🤝 (Correct word based on the list in the source should be "Enterprise", meaning she went to attend an *Enterprise* interview. Or possibly "final" or "job" interview, which are not in the list). Let's stick to words provided in the text list: undergo, downpour, enterprise, success, breakdown, look, interview.
            *   (i) A heavy **downpour** has been forecast.... ☔️
