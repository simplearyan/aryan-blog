### Summary of 'Nelson Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom'

This chapter is an excerpt from **Nelson Mandela's autobiography, *Long Walk to Freedom***. It focuses on a **historic occasion** in South Africa: **the inauguration** of the first democratic government after the end of apartheid.

**Apartheid** was a political system that separated people based on their race. Mandela and the African National Congress (ANC) fought against this system for a long time, leading to Mandela spending **thirty years in prison**. Finally, **democratic elections** were held in South Africa in 1994, and **Nelson Mandela became the country's first black President** after over three centuries of white rule.

The inauguration ceremony took place on **10 May 1994**, which dawned bright and clear. It was held in an **amphitheatre at the Union Buildings in Pretoria**. This was significant because the Union Buildings had previously been the centre of racial superiority under the apartheid system. The event was attended by an unusually large number of dignitaries and **world leaders**, making it the largest gathering of international leaders on South African soil at that time. Their presence signified the **triumph of something**, coming after many countries had broken off diplomatic relations due to apartheid.

During the ceremony, Mandela was sworn in and pledged to uphold the Constitution and devote himself to the well-being of the people. In his speech, he spoke about achieving **political emancipation** ‚Äì freedom from restriction. He set out the ideal of liberating all people from poverty, deprivation, suffering, and discrimination. He promised that the land would never again experience the oppression of one group by another.

A spectacular display by South African jets, helicopters, and troop carriers followed, demonstrating the military's loyalty to the new democratic government. Mandela noted that not long before, these same generals would have arrested him instead of saluting him.

Mandela reflected on the **sacrifices** made by thousands of African patriots in the struggle against apartheid. He felt he was the "sum of all those African patriots", pained that they could not witness this day. He discussed the deep wound apartheid left on the country, but also noted that decades of oppression produced individuals of **extraordinary courage, wisdom, and generosity**. He believes South Africa's greatest wealth is its people.

Mandela defines **courage** not as the absence of fear, but as the **triumph over fear**. He learned this from comrades who endured torture without breaking. He also reflects that while people may learn to hate, **love comes more naturally to the human heart** and can be taught. Even in difficult prison times, he saw glimmers of humanity in guards.

Finally, Mandela discusses the **"twin obligations"** every man has: to his family and to his people/country. Under apartheid, it was almost impossible for a man of colour to fulfil both, often leading to isolation if one chose to serve their people. His understanding of freedom changed from "transitory freedoms" as a boy and student to the realisation that **freedom is indivisible**; the chains on any of his people were chains on him. His 'hunger for freedom' transformed him from a frightened young man into a bold one. He also believes the oppressor is not truly free.

### Answers to the Questions

Here are answers to the questions from the excerpts, based directly on the information provided ‚ú®:

**From Oral Comprehension Check (Page 19):**

1.  **Where did the ceremonies take place?**
    The ceremonies took place in the **amphitheatre at the Union Buildings in Pretoria**.
2.  **Can you say how 10 May is an ‚Äòautumn day‚Äô in South Africa?**
    The provided sources do **not explain** how 10 May is an autumn day in South Africa. The sources only state that 10 May dawned bright and clear and ask this question.
3.  **At the beginning of his speech, Mandela mentions ‚Äúan extraordinary human disaster‚Äù. What does he mean by this? What is the ‚Äúglorious ‚Ä¶ human achievement‚Äù he speaks of at the end?**
    The "extraordinary human disaster" refers to the system of **apartheid** which caused deep hurt and suffering to his country and people. The ‚Äúglorious human achievement‚Äù is the **establishment of the first democratic, non-racial government** in South Africa. The sources define a "glorious... human achievement" as a sign of human feeling and relate it to the sun never setting on it, symbolising lasting freedom.
4.  **What does Mandela thank the international leaders for?**
    The sources don't explicitly state Mandela's words of thanks, but they mention that a large number of international leaders attended the inauguration. Their presence at the inauguration, after many countries had broken off diplomatic relations due to apartheid, signifies the **triumph** of a new system that recognises the rights and freedoms of all. It can be inferred that he thanks them for witnessing and validating this historic shift.
5.  **What ideals does he set out for the future of South Africa?**
    He sets out the ideals of liberating all people from **poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender, and other discrimination**. He also states that the land shall never again experience the **oppression of one by another**.

**From Oral Comprehension Check (Page 22):**

1.  **What do the military generals do? How has their attitude changed, and why?**
    The military generals **saluted Mandela and pledged their loyalty** to the new democratic government. Their attitude had changed significantly because not many years before, they would have **arrested him**. This change occurred because of the **establishment of a new government that had been freely and fairly elected**, symbolising the triumph over the previous system of racial superiority.
2.  **Why were two national anthems sung?**
    The provided sources do **not state** why two national anthems were sung.
3.  **How does Mandela describe the systems of government in his country (i) in the first decade, and (ii) in the final decade, of the twentieth century?**
    Based on the sources, he describes the system in the past (implicitly, in earlier decades of the 20th century, especially before the 1994 election) as based on **racial superiority** and characterised by **oppression and brutality**. The system in 1994 (the final decade) is described as one that **recognised the rights and freedoms of all peoples, regardless of the colour of their skin**.
4.  **What does courage mean to Mandela?**
    Mandela states that courage is **not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it**. The brave man is the one who **conquers that fear**.
5.  **Which does he think is natural, to love or to hate?**
    Mandela thinks **love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite**. He states that people must learn to hate, and therefore can be taught to love.

**From Oral Comprehension Check (Page 25):**

1.  **What ‚Äútwin obligations‚Äù does Mandela mention?**
    Mandela mentions twin obligations: obligations to his **family (parents, wife, children)** and obligations to his **people, community, and country**.
2.  **What did being free mean to Mandela as a boy, and as a student? How does he contrast these ‚Äútransitory freedoms‚Äù with ‚Äúthe basic and honourable freedoms‚Äù?**
    As a boy, freedom meant "transitory freedoms" like **running in the fields** near his mother's hut and being free to **swim in the clear streams**. As a student, it meant the freedom to **stay out at night, read what he pleased, and go where he chose**. He contrasts these with "the basic and honourable freedoms", which, based on his later reflections, include the freedom to live with dignity and self-respect and fulfil one's potential without being prevented by oppression or discrimination.
3.  **Does Mandela think the oppressor is free? Why/Why not?**
    No, Mandela does **not think the oppressor is free**. The source states that "A man who takes away another‚Äôs freedom is a **prisoner of hatred**".

**From Thinking about the Text (Page 23-24):**

1.  **Why did such a large number of international leaders attend the inauguration? What did it signify the triumph of?**
    A large number of international leaders attended, making it the largest gathering of international leaders on South African soil, because it was a historic occasion ‚Äì the inauguration of South Africa's first democratic government after the end of apartheid. Their attendance signified the **triumph** of a system that recognised the rights and freedoms of all people, regardless of race, representing the end of apartheid and the international community's acceptance of the new democratic South Africa.
2.  **What does Mandela mean when he says he is ‚Äúsimply the sum of all those African patriots‚Äù who had gone before him?**
    When Mandela says he is ‚Äúsimply the sum of all those African patriots who had gone before him‚Äù, he means that he sees himself as the **embodiment or result of the sacrifices and efforts of all the people who fought against apartheid before him**. He feels their struggle culminated in his position and this day.
3.  **Would you agree that the ‚Äúdepths of oppression‚Äù create ‚Äúheights of character‚Äù? How does Mandela illustrate this?**
    Mandela illustrates this idea by saying that the decades of oppression and brutality, while creating a deep wound, also had the unintended effect of **producing men of such extraordinary courage, wisdom, and generosity** as the prominent figures in the struggle against apartheid. He suggests that perhaps such profound suffering was necessary to create such great character.
4.  **How did Mandela‚Äôs understanding of freedom change with age and experience?**
    As a young boy, freedom meant "transitory freedoms" related to his immediate surroundings and activities. As a student, it expanded slightly to include basic freedoms like movement and reading. With age and experience under apartheid, his understanding deepened. He realised true freedom was not just personal but involved the freedom of all his people. His 'hunger' for the basic and honourable freedoms for his people transformed him, leading him to understand that freedom is indivisible and the lack of freedom for one meant lack of freedom for all. This changed him from a frightened man into a bold revolutionary.
5.  **How did Mandela‚Äôs ‚Äòhunger for freedom‚Äô change his life?**
    Mandela's 'hunger for freedom', specifically the desire for the freedom of his people to live with dignity and self-respect, animated and transformed his life. It changed him from a frightened young man into a bold one, drove a law-abiding attorney to become a criminal, turned a family-loving husband into a man without a home, and forced a life-loving man to live like a monk.
