### Summary of the Poem "No Men Are Foreign" 📖

"No Men Are Foreign" by James Kirkup is a powerful poem that **champions the idea of universal brotherhood** 🌍🤝. It argues that despite superficial differences like nationality, language, or appearance, all human beings are fundamentally the same. The poem reminds us that beneath the "uniforms" (which could be military or cultural distinctions), we all share the same basic biological needs, breathe the same air, walk on the same earth, and are sustained by similar natural processes. It highlights that our hands perform similar labour, and our eyes experience the same cycles of waking and sleeping. The poet warns against the destructive nature of hatred and war, explaining that when we are told to hate "our brothers," we ultimately harm ourselves, pollute the Earth, and violate the shared innocence of humanity. The poem concludes by reaffirming its central message: **no men are strange, and no countries are foreign**.

*   All are **aware of the same sun, air, and water**.

3.  "a **single body breathes** / Like ours".
4.  "The **land our brothers walk upon / Is earth like this**".

**I. 3. How many common features can you find in stanza 2? Pick out the words.** 🤝
From the second stanza, there are **five** common features:
1.  "They, too, **aware of sun and air and water**".
2.  "Are **fed by peaceful harvests**".
3.  "by **war’s long winter starv’d**" (sharing the suffering of war).
4.  "Their **hands are ours**".
5.  "A **labour not different from our own**".

**I. 4. “...whenever we are told to hate our brothers ...” When do you think this happens? Why? Who ‘tells’ us? Should we do as we are told at such times? What does the poet say?** 💔🌍
*   **When this happens:** This often happens during **periods of conflict, war, or political and social unrest** when groups are encouraged to view others as enemies or 'them'. It can stem from intense nationalism, religious fundamentalism, or racial prejudice.
*   **Why:** People are told to hate others to **mobilise support for war** ⚔️, to **maintain control**, or to **divert attention from internal problems** by creating an external 'enemy'.
*   **Who ‘tells’ us:** This 'telling' usually comes from **political leaders, propagandists, extremist groups, or biased media** who seek to manipulate public opinion and create division.
*   **Should we do as we are told?** **No**, the poet strongly advises against it.
*   **What the poet says:** The poet warns that if we hate our brothers, "it is ourselves / That we shall **dispossess, betray, condemn**". He further states that when we take up arms against each other, "It is the **human earth that we defile**" and our actions "outrage the innocence / Of air that is everywhere our own". He concludes by reiterating, "**Remember, no men are foreign, and no countries strange.**". This means that hatred and war ultimately harm humanity itself and the planet we all share.
