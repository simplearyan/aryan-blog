### Summary of the Poem "A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal" 📖

"A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal" by William Wordsworth is a poem about the **poet's feelings upon the death of a loved one** 💔. The poem begins by stating that a "slumber did my spirit seal", meaning a deep sleep or emotional numbness "closed off" his soul or mind. Before this, he had "no human fears" for her, suggesting a state of unshakeable belief in her invulnerability. He initially perceived her as a being that "could not feel / The touch of earthly years", implying an immunity to time and mortality. However, with her death, this illusion is shattered. The second stanza reveals her post-death state: she now has **"No motion... no force— / She neither hears nor sees"**. Instead of being in a 'heavenly' state, the poet imagines her as having become **one with nature**, being "Rolled round in earth’s diurnal course / With rocks and stones and trees". The poem reflects on the stark reality of death and the profound shift in the poet's perception of life and mortality.

*   **Mortality and the Irreversibility of Death** 💀: The poem starkly portrays the ultimate end of life, where physical motion, senses, and the passage of time cease to have any effect on the deceased.
*   **The Power of Nature's Embrace** 🌳: It highlights the idea of returning to nature after death, where the loved one becomes an intrinsic part of the natural world, moving with the Earth's daily rotation.
*   **Loss of Innocence and Reality of Grief** 😔: The initial "slumber" or lack of fear gives way to the harsh reality of loss, suggesting a profound shift from an idealised view of life to an acceptance of its fragility.

### Answers to "Thinking about the Poem" Questions ❓

Here are the answers to the questions from the "Thinking about the Poem" section for "A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal":

**1. “A slumber did my spirit seal,” says the poet. That is, a deep sleep ‘closed off’ his soul (or mind). How does the poet react to his loved one’s death? Does he feel bitter grief? Or does he feel a great peace?** 🤔
The poet’s reaction to his loved one's death is not explicitly described as bitter grief or great peace. Instead, the initial line "A slumber did my spirit seal" suggests a **state of numbness or emotional detachment** 🥶 that has 'closed off' his soul or mind. Before the death, he "had no human fears" for her, implying an **idealised, almost unrealistic, view of her invulnerability** to earthly concerns. The poem doesn't describe an outpouring of sorrow but rather a profound shift in perception, indicating a **deep and perhaps quiet, almost stunned, realisation** of mortality and loss.

**2. The passing of time will no longer affect her, says the poet. Which lines of the poem say this?** ⏳🚫
The lines that say the passing of time will no longer affect her are:
*   "She seemed a thing that could not feel / **The touch of earthly years.**"

**3. How does the poet imagine her to be, after death? Does he think of her as a person living in a very happy state (a ‘heaven’)? Or does he see her now as a part of nature? In which lines of the poem do you find your answer?** 🌿🌏
The poet **does not imagine her to be in a very happy state or a 'heaven'** after death. Instead, he sees her as having **become a part of nature**.

The lines that convey this are:
*   "No motion has she now, no force— / She neither hears nor sees, / **Rolled round in earth’s diurnal course / With rocks and stones and trees.**"

This suggests that she is now intertwined with the natural, inanimate elements of the Earth, moving with its daily rotation.
