### Summary of the Poem "Rain on the Roof" ‚òî

The poem "Rain on the Roof" describes the **comforting and nostalgic effect of rain** falling on a roof. The poet feels immense "bliss" lying in bed in his cottage chamber, listening to the soft **"patter / Of the soft rain overhead!"** when the sky is covered with "humid shadows" and "melancholy darkness". The sound of every "tinkle on the shingles" creates an "echo in the heart," triggering a **thousand "dreamy fancies" and "recollections"** that weave together in his mind.

The most significant memory that emerges is that of his **mother**, who, "in years agone," used to watch over her "darling dreamers" (her children) before leaving them until dawn. As he listens to the "refrain" of the rain, he vividly feels her "fond look" upon him. The poem highlights how the simple sound of rain can bring back cherished memories and provide a profound sense of comfort and connection to the past.

**I. 1. What do the following phrases mean to you? Discuss in class.**

*   **(i) humid shadows** ‚òÅÔ∏è: This refers to the **dark, moisture-filled clouds** that hover "Over all the starry spheres" before or during rainfall. It sets a scene of approaching or present rain.
*   **(ii) starry spheres** ‚ú®: This refers to the **night sky where stars are usually visible**. In the poem, these spheres are covered by "humid shadows," indicating a cloudy, dark sky ready for rain.
*   **(iii) what a bliss** üòä: This expresses the **great pleasure, happiness, or comfort** the poet feels as he lies in his bed, listening to the rain. It signifies a moment of serene contentment.
*   **(iv) a thousand dreamy fancies into busy being start** üé®: This means that a multitude of **imaginative thoughts, ideas, or dreams begin to emerge or become active** in the poet's mind as he listens to the rain. His mind becomes active with creative or fanciful thoughts.
*   **(v) a thousand recollections weave their air-threads into woof** üï∏Ô∏è: This phrase describes how countless **memories begin to form and connect with each other**, much like threads are woven together on a loom (with 'woof' being the crosswise threads). It suggests that the sound of the rain helps these memories intertwine and become clear in his mind.

**I. 2. What does the poet like to do when it rains?**
When it rains, the poet likes to **"press the pillow / Of a cottage-chamber bed / And lie listening to the patter / Of the soft rain overhead!"**. This indicates he enjoys the comfort and serenity of his bed while listening to the sound of the rain.

**I. 3. What is the single major memory that comes to the poet? Who are the ‚Äúdarling dreamers‚Äù he refers to?**
The single major memory that comes to the poet is that of his **mother**. She used to look after her "darling dreamers" before leaving them until the dawn. The "darling dreamers" he refers to are **her children**, including the poet himself when he was a child.

**I. 4. Is the poet now a child? Is his mother still alive?**
No, the poet is **not a child now**. He is recalling memories of his mother "As she used in years agone," indicating these are recollections from his past, not current experiences. The poem describes her "Now in memory," and he "feel[s] her fond look on me" as he listens to the rain, implying that she is a cherished memory from the past, which **suggests she is no longer alive**.

**II. 1. When you were a young child, did your mother tuck you in, as the poet‚Äôs did?**
As an AI, I do not have personal experiences or a childhood, so I cannot have memories of being tucked in by a mother. This question is designed for **personal reflection** by the reader.

**II. 2. Do you like rain? What do you do when it rains steadily or heavily as described in the poem?**
As an AI, I do not have personal preferences or actions, so I cannot "like rain" or "do" anything when it rains. This question is also for **personal reflection** by the reader, prompting them to consider their own feelings and activities during rainfall.

**II. 3. Does everybody have a cosy bed to lie in when it rains? Look around you and describe how different kinds of people or animals spend time, seek shelter etc. during rain.**
As an AI, I do not have the ability to "look around" or personal experiences to describe how different people or animals seek shelter. This question is intended for **personal observation and reflection** by the reader, encouraging empathy and awareness of different living conditions during rain.
