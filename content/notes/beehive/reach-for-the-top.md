Here's a summary of the chapter "Reach for the Top" and answers to its associated questions, designed for ease of understanding with emojis! üöÄüßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Summary of "Reach for the Top" üåü

"Reach for the Top" is a unit in the Beehive textbook that features **two inspiring biographical pieces**. It explores the theme of **persistent endeavours to achieve success and recognition**, highlighting individuals who overcame significant barriers through determination, hard work, and courage.

**Part I focuses on Santosh Yadav**, the only woman in the world to have scaled Mt. Everest twice. Born into a traditional society that valued sons, Santosh was not content with the conventional way of life. She preferred shorts over traditional dresses and was determined to live life on her own terms. Despite initial resistance from her parents, she pursued education in Delhi and then in Jaipur, where she began her climbing journey after being inspired by villagers ascending the Aravalli Hills. Her story showcases her **iron will, physical endurance, and mental toughness**. She also demonstrates compassion by sharing oxygen with a fellow climber during an Everest expedition and is a fervent environmentalist, having brought down 500 kilograms of garbage from the Himalayas.

**Part II introduces Maria Sharapova**, a Russian tennis player who reached the world number one position in women's tennis at a young age. Her rapid ascent began nine years before her peak, requiring **immense sacrifice**. At barely ten years old, she was sent to the United States for training, enduring a heart-wrenching two-year separation from her mother due to visa restrictions. Maria's story highlights her **talent, unwavering desire to succeed, and readiness to sacrifice**. While acknowledging that money is a motivation, her ultimate dream was to become number one in the world.

Both stories encourage students to think about **potential barriers to success and how individuals can overcome them**, emphasizing the importance of hard work and clear goals.

#### Thinking about Language

**I. Identify the two parts in the sentences below by underlining the part that gives us the information in brackets, as shown above.**

1.  <u>Where other girls wore traditional Indian dresses</u>, Santosh preferred shorts. (Contrasts her dress with that of others)
2.  She left home and <u>got herself enrolled in a school in Delhi</u>. (Tells us what happened after the first action.)
3.  She decided to fight the system <u>when the right moment arrived</u>. (Tells us when she was going to fight the system.)
4.  Little Maria had not yet celebrated her tenth birthday <u>when she was packed off to train in the United States</u>. (Tells us when Maria was sent to the U.S.)

**II. Now rewrite the pairs of sentences given below as one sentence.**

1.  Grandfather told me about the old days. All books were printed on paper then.

2.  What do you do after you finish the book? Perhaps you just throw it away.
    **What do you do after you finish the book? Perhaps you just throw it away.** (This sentence is already phrased as two distinct questions, the instruction asks to rewrite as 'one sentence', so it would likely be a question followed by a related question or a conditional sentence.)

Her "iron will" and "mental toughness" allowed her to pursue climbing despite societal expectations and initial parental reluctance.
*   **Independent** ‚úÖ: Santosh showed strong **independence** by leaving home for Delhi at sixteen to pursue education, even offering to work part-time to pay her fees if her parents refused. She forged her own path, enrolling in mountaineering courses and achieving her goals without being swayed by traditional norms.
