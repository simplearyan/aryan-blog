### 🎶 The Sound of Music: Chapter Summary 🎻

The chapter "The Sound of Music" is divided into two inspiring biographical pieces.

**Part I: Evelyn Glennie Listens to Sound Without Hearing It** 👂❌
This part introduces us to **Evelyn Glennie**, a remarkable percussionist. Evelyn's hearing loss was gradual, noticed by her mother at age eight and confirmed to be severely impaired by age eleven due to nerve damage. Despite being advised to go to a school for the deaf, Evelyn was **determined to pursue music**. She was immensely helped by percussionist **Ron Forbes**, who encouraged her to feel the music rather than hear it with her ears. He taught her to **sense vibrations through different parts of her body** – for example, higher notes through the top of her waist and lower notes through her lower body. Evelyn learned to feel music through her skin, cheekbones, hair, and even through her bare feet when performing on a wooden platform. She auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London at seventeen, achieving the highest marks ever, and went on to become a **world-renowned solo percussionist**, giving concerts globally and performing free in prisons and hospitals. Her story highlights **determination, hard work, and courage** in overcoming physical barriers.

**Part II: The Shehnai of Bismillah Khan** 🎺🇮🇳
This section tells the story of the shehnai maestro, **Ustad Bismillah Khan**. The shehnai's origin is traced back to the pungi, a reeded instrument banned by Emperor Aurangzeb for its shrill sound. A barber from a family of professional musicians transformed the pungi into the shehnai by choosing a longer, broader pipe with seven holes, which produced **soft and melodious sounds**. Traditionally, the shehnai was played only in temples, at weddings, and during auspicious ceremonies.
Bismillah Khan took to music early, fascinated by his maternal uncles practising the shehnai. He began accompanying his uncle, Ali Bux, to the Vishnu temple in Benaras and practised tirelessly by the **banks of the River Ganga**, which inspired him to improvise new raagas. His **big break came in 1938 with All India Radio**, making him a frequently heard shehnai player. He later gained international recognition, including playing at the **Red Fort on India's Independence Day in 1947** and receiving India's highest civilian award, the **Bharat Ratna**. Bismillah Khan remained deeply rooted in his home country, refusing to leave Benaras or India, even declining to start a shehnai school in the U.S.A. because he could not transport the River Ganga there. His life exemplifies profound dedication to music and his cultural heritage.

### 🤔 Thinking About the Text: Questions and Answers

#### Part I: Evelyn Glennie 👂

**I. Answer these questions in a few words or a couple of sentences each.**

1.  **How old was Evelyn when she went to the Royal Academy of Music?**
    Evelyn was younger than **seventeen years old** when she went to the prestigious Royal Academy of Music in London.
2.  **When was her deafness first noticed? When was it confirmed?**
    Her deafness was first noticed by her mother when Evelyn was **eight years old**. It was later confirmed when she was **eleven**, after her headmistress urged her parents to take her to a specialist.

**II. Answer each of these questions in a short paragraph (30–40 words).**

1.  **Who helped her to continue with music? What did he do and say?**
    Percussionist **Ron Forbes** helped Evelyn continue with music. He advised her not to listen through her ears, but to **try to sense the music in other ways**. He taught her to feel the vibrations of different notes through various parts of her body.
2.  **Name the various places and causes for which Evelyn performs.**
    Evelyn performs at **regular concerts** globally. Additionally, she dedicates her time to giving **free concerts in prisons and hospitals**. She also gives high priority to classes for young musicians, inspiring the next generation.

**III. Answer the question in two or three paragraphs (100–150 words).**

1.  **How does Evelyn hear music?**
    Evelyn Glennie "hears" music not through her ears, but by **feeling its vibrations and resonances through her entire body** 🎼. When she plays the xylophone, she senses the sound passing up the stick into her fingertips. For drums, she leans against them to feel the flow of resonances into her body.

    A crucial part of her method involves removing her shoes when performing on a wooden platform. This allows the vibrations of the music to pass directly through her bare feet and up her legs, enabling her to internalise the sound more deeply. Her unique ability to feel music, cultivated with the guidance of Ron Forbes, who encouraged her to open her mind and body to sound, is what makes her musical expression so extraordinary.
