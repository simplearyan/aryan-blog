Okay, here's a summary of the chapter "A Photograph" and answers to the questions, explained in an easy-to-understand way, formatted for a blog post! 😄📸📖

### Understanding 'A Photograph': A Look at Memory and Time

The chapter "A Photograph" features a poem by Shirley Toulson. It's a reflective piece that uses a single photograph to explore themes of memory, loss, and the passage of time. The sources note that poems are included to make students more sensitive to literary writing and appreciate language's rhythm and sound patterns. This poem is placed after "The Portrait of a Lady" due to its similar theme, likely relating to memories of elderly women.

The poem essentially looks at three distinct phases or moments captured or evoked by a photograph:

1.  **The Past: The Beach Holiday** 🏖️👧👧👩‍👧‍👧: The poem describes an old photograph, likely on cardboard. It shows the poet's mother as a young girl, around twelve years old, with her two girl cousins, Betty and Dolly. They are paddling at the beach, holding her hands, and smiling at their uncle who is taking the photo. This is a moment from the mother's distant past.
2.  **The Middle: Years Later - Remembering the Past** 😂👵💬: Sometime later, perhaps twenty or thirty years after the photo was taken, the mother would look at the snapshot and laugh. She would point out her cousins and how they were dressed for the beach. Her laughter about this past memory is described as her own past from the poet's perspective.
3.  **The Present (for the Poet): Loss and Silence** 😔😶: The third phase deals with the poet's present, after her mother has died. The mother has been dead for nearly as many years as she lived as the girl in the photograph. In this current reality, the poet is left with the memory of her mother's laughter and the photograph, but the circumstance of her mother's death leaves her with nothing to say; its silence makes the poet silent too.

The poem highlights how the **sea appears to have changed less** over time compared to the people whose feet it washed, suggesting the transient nature of human life.

### Thinking Through the Poem: Questions Answered

Let's look at the questions posed about the poem and what the sources imply about their answers:

1.  **What does the word ‘cardboard’ denote in the poem? Why has this word been used?**
    *   The word 'cardboard' likely denotes the **photograph itself**, specifically the **backing onto which the photograph is stuck**.
    *   It has been used possibly to highlight the **age and physical nature of the old photograph** – a tangible object from the past. It sets the scene by immediately identifying the object that triggers the memories and reflection.

2.  **What has the camera captured?**
    *   The camera has captured a **moment in time from the past**.
    *   Specifically, it shows **the poet's mother** as a young girl, about twelve, with her **two cousins, Betty and Dolly**, paddling at the beach and smiling for the photo.

3.  **What has not changed over the years? Does this suggest something to you?**
    *   The sources explicitly state that **the sea** is what appears to have **changed less** over the years.
    *   This suggests the **permanence of nature** or the natural world **compared to the transient nature of human life**. While the sea endures, the people change, age, and eventually pass away.

4.  **The poet’s mother laughed at the snapshot. What did this laugh indicate?**
    *   The source tells us she would laugh at the snapshot years later and comment on how they were dressed.
    *   This laugh likely indicated her **amusement and perhaps fondness for the past memory**. It could also carry a hint of **nostalgia** or even a **wry acceptance** of how much things (and people) change over time.

5.  **What is the meaning of the line “Both wry with the laboured ease of loss.”**
    *   This is a bit complex, but the sources describe it as linking the mother's past (the sea holiday) and the poet's past (her mother's laughter). Both are connected to a sense of **loss**.
    *   "Wry" suggests a **dry, mocking, or slightly sarcastic humour**, often acknowledging something difficult or unpleasant.
    *   "Laboured ease of loss" is an interesting contrast. "Loss" is difficult. "Ease" implies something is easy, but "laboured" means it required effort. It could mean that dealing with the loss (of youth, of the person) has become a **practised or accustomed state**, almost an "ease" that was "laboured" to achieve. Both the mother's memory of her lost youth/friends and the poet's memory of her lost mother are tinged with this difficult, perhaps slightly bitter or twisted, acceptance of loss.

6.  **What does “this circumstance” refer to?**
    *   The line "And of this circumstance There is nothing to say at all. Its silence silences." comes immediately after the poet mentions her mother has been dead for many years.
    *   Therefore, "this circumstance" refers to the **circumstance of the mother's death**. The finality and impact of this loss are so profound that the poet feels speechless.

7.  **The three stanzas depict three different phases. What are they?**
    *   As discussed in the summary above, based on the structure and content described, the three phases are:
        *   **The mother's childhood/youth** as captured in the photograph (the beach holiday).
        *   **The mother's middle age** reflecting on the photograph and her past (her laughter years later).
        *   **The poet's present** reflecting on the loss of her mother (the silence after her death).

These questions, as the notes suggest, help readers understand the text, make inferences, establish empathy, and notice the structure and word choices in the poem.

I hope this breakdown helps you understand the poem and its meaning better! 😄👍
