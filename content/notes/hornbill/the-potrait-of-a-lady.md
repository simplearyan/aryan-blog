Okay, let's break down "The Portrait of a Lady" chapter from the sources you provided.

First, here is a summary of the chapter based on the text:

**Summary of The Portrait of a Lady**

The chapter is a memoir by the author about his **grandmother**. He describes her as being **old and wrinkled** for the twenty years he knew her. People said she was once young and pretty, but he found this hard to believe. He contrasts her with his grandfather's portrait, which showed him looking very old. His grandmother was **short, fat, slightly bent**, with wrinkles everywhere. She was not pretty but was always **beautiful**, moving around the house in white clothes, balancing her stoop with one hand and telling the beads of her **rosary** with the other. Her face was pale and puckered, and her lips constantly moved in inaudible prayer. To him, she was like the peaceful "winter landscape in the mountains".

The author and his grandmother were **good friends** in the village, where they lived together and she helped him get ready for the school attached to the temple. She would say her prayers, hoping he would listen, and while he was taught by the priest, she read scriptures inside the temple. They would walk home together, feeding **village dogs** stale chapattis.

This changed when they moved to the city. This marked a **"turning-point"** in their friendship. They shared a room, but the author went to an English school by bus. They saw less of each other. She was unhappy with the English school's focus on Western science and lack of religious teaching. She was also disturbed by the idea of music lessons, associating music with "harlots and beggars". Her silence showed disapproval.

As the author grew, the distance between them increased. When he went to University and got his own room, the common link of friendship was "snapped". She **"accepted her seclusion with resignation"**. She spent most of her day at her spinning-wheel, reciting prayers. Her only relaxation was in the afternoon when she fed **sparrows** in the courtyard. Hundreds of birds would gather, creating a "veritable bedlam of chirrupings". She loved this, smiling at the birds that perched on her, even her head. This was her happiest time.

When the author went abroad for five years, his grandmother was not sentimental. She saw him off at the station, praying. When he returned, she met him, looking no older. Her routine was unchanged; her happiest moments were still feeding the sparrows.

The evening before she died, she dramatically changed her routine. For the first time, she **did not pray**. Instead, she gathered local women, got an old drum, and sang songs of homecoming warriors, thumping the drum vigorously. They had to stop her from overstraining.

The next morning, she fell ill. She knew her end was near and decided not to talk to the family, regretting the previous evening's omission of prayer. She died peacefully while praying, her rosary falling from her lifeless fingers.

Finally, the sparrows gathered in silence around her body, showing their sorrow by not chirruping or eating the bread offered by the author's mother. They only flew away when her body was carried off for cremation.
