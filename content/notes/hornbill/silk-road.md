Okay, here is a summary of the chapter "Silk Road" and the answers to your questions, based on the sources, presented for ease of understanding with emojis. 😊

### Summary of Silk Road

The chapter "Silk Road" by Nick Middleton recounts a journey from Ravu towards Mount Kailash, following parts of the ancient trade route. The author, accompanied by his guide Tsetan and initially a man named Daniel, sets off after receiving a traditional sheepskin coat as a farewell gift. Their route takes them across vast open plains populated by wildlife like gazelles and wild ass (kyang), and they pass solitary drokbas tending their flocks. As they approach snow-capped mountains, the journey becomes more challenging, involving high mountain passes and navigating snow blockages. They reach a high pass at 5,515 metres, marked by a cairn, where they perform a traditional clockwise circumambulation. Descending, they stop by a dry salt lake, a remnant of the ancient Tethys Ocean, observing men working there. They reach the town of Hor, described as grim and miserable despite being located on the shore of the venerated Lake Manasarovar. The author's experience there contrasts sharply with earlier, more spiritually profound accounts. They continue to Darchen, where the author suffers from altitude sickness, experiencing sleeplessness and fear. He visits a Tibetan doctor who diagnoses a cold and altitude effects and provides traditional medicine, including pellets that looked suspiciously like sheep dung, which helps him sleep soundly. Tsetan leaves after seeing the author recover, mentioning a Buddhist perspective on death alongside a practical concern for business. In Darchen, the author finds himself disappointed by the lack of pilgrims, having arrived too early in the season, which makes the prospect of undertaking the kora (pilgrimage) alone daunting. His spirits lift when he meets Norbu, a fellow academic from Beijing who also plans to do the kora, and they decide to team up, despite Norbu being ill-equipped but enthusiastic.

### Answers to Your Questions

Here are the answers to the questions from the sources:

1.  **Give reasons for the following statements.**
    *   **(i) The article has been titled ‘Silk Road.’** The article is titled "Silk Road" because the journey described follows a route that was historically part of the ancient Silk Road trade network. The author travels towards Mount Kailash, located in a region with historical connections to this route. 🗺️📍
    *   **(ii) Tibetan mastiffs were popular in China’s imperial courts.** Tibetan mastiffs were popular in China's imperial courts because they were brought to the courts along the Silk Road in ancient times as a form of tribute from Tibet. 🐶👑
    *   **(iii) The author’s experience at Hor was in stark contrast to earlier accounts of the place.** The author's experience at Hor was in stark contrast to earlier accounts because previous travellers, such as Ekai Kawaguchi and Sven Hedin, were profoundly moved by the sanctity of Lake Manasarovar, experiencing deep emotion and even crying. In contrast, the author found the town of Hor on the lake's shore to be a "grim, miserable place" filled with dust, rocks, and refuse. 😥➡️😒
    *   **(iv) The author was disappointed with Darchen.** The author was disappointed with Darchen primarily because there were no pilgrims present. He had timed his arrival for the beginning of the pilgrimage season but found he was too early. Undertaking the pilgrimage (kora) alone was not something he fancied. 😞🚶‍♂️
    *   **(v) The author thought that his positive thinking strategy worked well after all.** The author felt his positive thinking strategy had worked well after all when he met Norbu. Earlier, he had felt his options were severely limited and his self-help wasn't progressing. Meeting Norbu, who also wanted to do the kora and agreed to team up, provided a solution and a companion for the journey. 👍🤝

2.  **Briefly comment on:**
    *   **(i) The purpose of the author’s journey to Mount Kailash.** The purpose of the author's journey to Mount Kailash was to complete the kora, which is the pilgrimage around the mountain. 🙏🏔️
    *   **(ii) The author’s physical condition in Darchen.** In Darchen, the author was suffering from a cold and the effects of high altitude. He experienced symptoms like a blocked nostril, difficulty breathing when lying down, an "odd" feeling in his chest, and severe sleeplessness, which caused him fear. He sought medical help and was given Tibetan medicine that allowed him to sleep soundly. 🤒😴
    *   **(iii) The author’s meeting with Norbu.** The author met Norbu in a cafe in Darchen when he was feeling disappointed and alone. Norbu was a Tibetan academic from Beijing who had also come to do the kora. This meeting was a significant relief for the author, as they decided to undertake the pilgrimage together as a team. Norbu's willingness, despite being physically ill-equipped, provided the author with a much-needed companion. 👋😊
    *   **(iv) Tsetan’s support to the author during the journey.** Tsetan provided essential support to the author throughout the journey. He acted as the guide and driver, navigating the challenging route and handling issues like snow blockages and tyre punctures. He also helped the author communicate with local people, such as the doctor, and ensured the author was recovering before leaving. Tsetan's presence was crucial for the author's progress and safety. 💪🚗
    *   **(v) “As a Buddhist, he told me, he knew that it didn’t really matter if I passed away, but he thought it would be bad for business.”** This statement from Tsetan reveals a juxtaposition of his spiritual beliefs and his professional responsibilities. As a Buddhist, he holds a perspective where death might be seen as less of a tragic event in the grand scheme of existence. However, he also acknowledged the practical reality that the death of a client would negatively impact his business as a guide. It highlights how he balances his faith with the demands of his work in the material world. 🙏💼
