### Summary of Father to Son

The poem "Father to Son" explores the **strained and distant relationship** between a father and his son who share a home but feel like strangers. The father feels he knows "Nothing of him", reflecting a lack of understanding despite years of living together. He recalls when the son was small and wishes to rebuild their connection from that time. The father feels a sense of loss and regret, questioning if he somehow destroyed the bond or if the son has grown into a world entirely separate from his own. There is a deep **silence** and lack of understanding between them. The father longs for reconciliation, wishing the son would return metaphorically like a "prodigal" to his home. Both father and son feel a mutual longing for forgiveness and connection, extending "empty hand[s]" towards each other. The poem is noted as being **autobiographical in nature**, describing this specific father-son relationship.

### Answers to Your Questions

Here are the answers to the questions from the sources:

1.  **Does the poem talk of an exclusively personal experience or is it fairly universal?**
    The poem is noted as being **autobiographical in nature**, describing the specific relationship between the author and his son. However, while personal, the feelings of distance, lack of understanding between generations, and longing for connection described in the poem touch upon themes that are often **universal human experiences**. The relationship dynamics and emotions explored resonate with many parent-child relationships where communication breaks down despite close proximity. ü§îüåç

2.  **How is the father‚Äôs helplessness brought out in the poem?**
    The father's helplessness is shown in several ways:
    *   His admission that he **does not understand the child** he has lived with for years and **knows "Nothing of him"**.
    *   His inability to **"share" what the son loves**, highlighting a fundamental gap in their interests and worlds.
    *   The pervasive **"Silence surrounds us"**, indicating a failure in communication.
    *   His regretful questioning about the son's upbringing ("Yet have I killed / The seed I spent or sown it where / The land is his and none of mine?").
    *   His confusion about his own emotions ("I cannot understand / Myself, why anger grows from grief").
    *   The poignant image of them both reaching out with **"an empty hand, / Longing for something to forgive"**, signifying their inability to bridge the gap despite wanting to. üòü

3.  **Identify the phrases and lines that indicate distance between father and son.**
    Phrases and lines that indicate distance include:
    *   **"I do not understand this child"**
    *   **"We have lived together now / In the same house for years. I know / Nothing of him"**
    *   **"We speak like strangers"**
    *   **"there‚Äôs no sign / Of understanding in the air"**
    *   **"what he loves I cannot share"**
    *   **"Silence surrounds us"**
    *   **"We each put out an empty hand"** üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è...üö∂

4.  **Does the poem have a consistent rhyme scheme?**
    Looking at the rhyming words at the end of each line:
    *   Stanza 1: child (A), now (B), years (C), know (B), how (B), killed (A). Rhyme Scheme: ABBCBA.
    *   Stanza 2: where (A), mine (B), sign (B), air (A), design (B), share (A). Rhyme Scheme: ABBABA.
    *   Stanza 3: have (A), to (B), knew (B), move (A), too (B), love (A). Rhyme Scheme: ABBABA.
    *   Stanza 4: live (A), land (B), understand (B), grief (A), hand (B), forgive (A). Rhyme Scheme: ABBABA.
    While stanzas 2, 3, and 4 follow the same ABBABA scheme, the first stanza is different (ABBCBA). Therefore, the poem **does not have a fully consistent rhyme scheme** across all stanzas, although it uses a clear pattern for most of the poem. ‚ú®‚úçÔ∏è
