### Summary of "The Last Lesson" ‚ú®üìöüò¢

"The Last Lesson" is set during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871), after France was defeated by Prussia. In this story, the French districts of **Alsace and Lorraine have passed into Prussian hands**.

The narrative follows a young schoolboy named Franz. One morning, Franz started late for school and was **in great dread of a scolding**, especially because his teacher, M. Hamel, was supposed to question them on participles, and Franz knew nothing about them. He was tempted to skip school and spend the day outdoors, enjoying the warm, bright weather, the chirping birds, and the Prussian soldiers drilling. However, he resisted the temptation and hurried to school.

As he passed the town hall, Franz noticed a **crowd in front of the bulletin-board**. For the past two years, all the bad news, such as lost battles, the draft, and orders from the commanding officer, had come from there. The blacksmith, Wachter, called out to him not to rush, saying he would get to school in plenty of time, which Franz initially thought was teasing.

Upon reaching school, Franz found it unusually still. Normally, there was a great bustle with desks opening and closing, lessons repeated loudly in unison, and the teacher's ruler rapping. He had planned to use this commotion to get to his seat unnoticed, but that day it was as quiet as a Sunday morning. He saw his classmates already in their places and M. Hamel walking around with his iron ruler. Franz was frightened and blushed as he had to open the door and go in before everyone.

Unexpectedly, M. Hamel spoke kindly to him, telling him to go to his place quickly as they were starting without him. After overcoming his fright, Franz noticed their teacher was wearing his beautiful green coat, frilled shirt, and embroidered silk cap, attire he only wore on inspection and prize days. The school felt strange and solemn. What surprised Franz most was seeing **village people sitting quietly on the back benches**, including old Hauser, the former mayor, and the former postmaster. Everybody looked sad.

M. Hamel then mounted his chair and announced in a grave and gentle tone that **this would be their last French lesson**. He explained that an order had come from Berlin to teach only German in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine, and their new master would arrive the next day.

These words were a "thunderclap" to Franz. He realised this was the news posted on the bulletin board. He felt regret that he hardly knew how to write French and would never learn any more. He felt sorry for not learning his lessons, for seeking birds' eggs, or going sliding. His books, which he had previously found bothersome, suddenly became old friends he couldn't give up. The idea of M. Hamel going away made Franz forget his teacher's ruler and crankiness. He understood that M. Hamel was wearing his fine clothes in honour of this last lesson, and the village people were there because they regretted not attending school more and wanted to thank M. Hamel for his forty years of faithful service, showing respect for their lost country.

When it was Franz's turn to recite, he got mixed up on the first words about participles and stood holding his desk, heart beating, afraid to look up. M. Hamel did not scold him, noting that Franz must feel bad enough and lamenting how Alsace had put off learning until tomorrow. He said that the Prussians would have the right to question their claim to be Frenchmen when they couldn't speak or write their own language. M. Hamel stated that **they all had a great deal to reproach themselves with**. He mentioned that parents weren't anxious enough for their children to learn, preferring them to work for money, and that he himself was also to blame for sending students to water his flowers or giving them holidays when he wanted to go fishing.

M. Hamel then spoke about the French language, calling it the most beautiful, clearest, and most logical language in the world. He urged them to guard it and never forget it, because **when a people are enslaved, as long as they hold fast to their language it is as if they had the key to their prison**.

After the grammar lesson, where Franz was amazed at how easy it seemed, they had a writing lesson. M. Hamel gave them new copies with "France, Alsace" written in a beautiful hand. Everyone worked quietly, with only the sound of pens scratching. Even the youngest students focused on tracing their letters. Franz wondered if even the pigeons would be made to sing in German.

Throughout the lesson, M. Hamel sat motionless, gazing at everything as if to fix it in his mind. He had been there for forty years. Franz imagined how heartbroken he must be to leave, hearing his sister packing upstairs.

Despite the sadness, M. Hamel had the courage to hear every lesson. After writing, they had history, and the youngest children chanted their lessons. Old Hauser in the back, holding his primer, spelled the letters with them, crying, his voice trembling. It was an emotional moment that made everyone want to laugh and cry.

At noon, the church clock struck twelve, followed by the Angelus. Simultaneously, the trumpets of the Prussian soldiers returning from drill sounded under the windows. M. Hamel stood up, pale and appearing taller than usual. He tried to speak but was choked with emotion. He turned to the blackboard and wrote as large as he could: **"Vive La France!"**. Then he stopped, leaned his head against the wall, and with a gesture, dismissed the school.

### Questions and Answers from the Source üìù

Here are the answers to the questions based directly on the provided excerpts from "lefl101.pdf":

**Comprehension Check Questions**:

1.  **What was Franz expected to be prepared with for school that day?**
    Franz was expected to be prepared to be questioned on **participles**.
2.  **What did Franz notice that was unusual about the school that day?**
    Franz noticed several unusual things:
    *   The school was **very still**; there was no usual bustle.
    *   M. Hamel was wearing his **special, beautiful clothes** (green coat, frilled shirt, silk cap).
    *   The school seemed **strange and solemn**.
    *   **Village people** were sitting on the back benches, which were usually empty.
3.  **What had been put up on the bulletin-board?**
    The bulletin-board was where all the **bad news** for the past two years had been posted, such as lost battles, the draft, and orders from the commanding officer. On this particular day, **the order from Berlin to teach only German** in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine had been put up there.

**Understanding the Text Questions**:

1.  **The people in this story suddenly realise how precious their language is to them. What shows you this? Why does this happen?**
    This realisation is shown by:
    *   Franz's reaction to M. Hamel's announcement, which felt like a "thunderclap".
    *   Franz's immediate **regret** for not having learned his language.
    *   His sudden newfound appreciation for his French books.
    *   M. Hamel's description of French as the most beautiful, clearest, and logical language, and stating that holding fast to one's language is the key to freedom when enslaved.
    *   The **sudden attentiveness** everyone showed during the lesson.
    *   The presence of the **village people** on the back benches, who came to pay their respects and because they regretted not going to school more.
    *   Old Hauser crying while spelling the letters.
    *   M. Hamel's emotional attempt to speak at the end, culminating in him writing "Vive La France!".

    This sudden realisation happens because **the order has come from Berlin to teach only German** in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. This means it was their last French lesson, and they were losing the right to study and speak their own language.

2.  **Franz thinks, ‚ÄúWill they make them sing in German, even the pigeons?‚Äù What could this mean?**
    When Franz sees the pigeons cooing very low on the roof during the writing lesson, he thinks, ‚ÄúWill they make them sing in German, even the pigeons?‚Äù. This question could mean:
    *   It reflects the **extent of the imposition** by the Prussians, wondering if the conquerors would try to control even nature and animals, making them speak German too.
    *   It suggests the **absurdity and profound sadness** of the situation ‚Äì the loss of their language is so total that Franz feels it affects everything around them, perhaps implying that their own language and culture are as natural to them as cooing is to pigeons.
    *   It symbolises the **complete dominance** the Prussians aim for, potentially forcing their language and culture upon everything, even those who naturally speak another "language" (like the cooing of pigeons).

**Talking about the Text Questions**:

1.  **‚ÄúWhen a people are enslaved, as long as they hold fast to their language it is as if they had the key to their prison.‚Äù Can you think of examples in history where a conquered people had their language taken away from them or had a language imposed on them?**
    The provided source material includes this quote and question for discussion but **does not provide any historical examples or information** to answer this question.

2.  **What happens to a linguistic minority in a state? How do you think they can keep their language alive? For example: Punjabis in Bangalore, Tamilians in Mumbai, Kannadigas in Delhi, Gujaratis in Kolkata.**
    The provided source material poses these questions and gives examples for discussion but **does not provide any information or answers** regarding the experiences of linguistic minorities or how they can preserve their language.

3.  **Is it possible to carry pride in one‚Äôs language too far? Do you know what ‚Äòlinguistic chauvinism‚Äô means?**
    The provided source material asks these questions for discussion but **does not provide a definition for 'linguistic chauvinism' or discuss** the concept of taking language pride too far.

**Additional Understanding the Text Questions**:

1.  **What changes did the order from Berlin cause in school that day?**
    The order from Berlin caused significant changes:
    *   It was announced that **this would be the last French lesson**, and only German would be taught from the next day.
    *   The usual noisy, bustling school atmosphere was replaced by **unusual stillness and solemnity**.
    *   M. Hamel wore his **special attire**.
    *   **Village elders** attended the class and sat on the back benches.
    *   M. Hamel spoke passionately about the **importance of the French language**.
    *   Everyone, including Franz and the village elders, was **unusually attentive** during the lessons.
    *   New writing copies with "France, Alsace" were used.
    *   There was a general feeling of **sadness and regret** over losing the language.
2.  **How did Franz‚Äôs feelings about M. Hamel and school change?**
    Initially, Franz was **afraid of M. Hamel** and expected a scolding, even considering running away to avoid school and the lesson on participles. He viewed his books as a "nuisance" and M. Hamel as "cranky".

    After hearing about the last French lesson, Franz's feelings changed dramatically:
    *   He felt a profound sense of **regret** for not having learned his lessons and language properly.
    *   His books, previously a burden, suddenly became "old friends".
    *   The idea of M. Hamel leaving made him **forget about his ruler and his crankiness**.
    *   He became very attentive and was amazed at how well he understood the lesson that day.
    *   He developed **sympathy and respect** for M. Hamel, seeing him as "poor man" in his Sunday clothes, honouring the last lesson.
