Certainly! Based on the source material provided, here is a summary and theme of the poem "My Mother at Sixty-six", along with answers to the questions asked.

**Summary of "My Mother at Sixty-six"**

The poem recounts the poet's journey by car from her parents' home to Cochin one Friday morning. While driving, she observes her mother sitting beside her. She notices her mother dozing, open-mouthed, with her face looking colourless and resembling that of a corpse. This sight brings the poet pain as she realises her mother is indeed as old as she appears. To distract herself from this painful thought, the poet looks out of the car window. Outside, she sees vibrant scenes: young trees appearing to sprint past and cheerful children coming out of their homes. After reaching the airport and passing through the security check, the poet stands a few yards away from her mother and looks at her again. She finds her mother looking weak, pale, and like a late winter's moon. This brings back an old, familiar ache, her childhood fear. Despite these feelings, the poet's parting words are "see you soon, Amma," and all she does is smile repeatedly.

**Theme of "My Mother at Sixty-six"**

The poem primarily explores the **theme of ageing** and the **complex emotions** experienced by a child witnessing the decline of their parent. It highlights the **pain and fear** associated with the realisation of a loved one's mortality. The natural process of ageing is contrasted with the **vitality and energy of youth and the external world**. The poem also touches upon the **subtleties of human relationships**, particularly the mother-daughter bond, and the effort to conceal feelings of sadness and anxiety behind a facade of reassurance, symbolised by the poet's smile.

**Answers to the Questions:**

Here are the answers to the "Think it out" questions provided in the source, presented for ease of understanding:

1.  **What is the kind of pain and ache that the poet feels?**
    The poet feels a **pain** when she sees her mother's aged and corpse-like face, realising how old she truly is. The **ache** is an old, familiar childhood fear that returns. This fear is linked to her mother's frail appearance and the potential loss or separation due to ageing and mortality 😥💔.

2.  **Why are the young trees described as ‘sprinting’?**
    The young trees are described as ‘sprinting’ because, as the poet's car moves, they seem to be **running past quickly**. This imagery represents **youth, energy, and the rapid passage of time**, offering a stark contrast to the mother's still, passive state and her age. 🌳💨

3.  **Why has the poet brought in the image of the merry children ‘spilling out of their homes’?**
    The image of 'merry children spilling out of their homes' is introduced to provide a **contrast**. The children represent **joy, exuberance, life, and vitality**, which stands in opposition to the poet's mother's ageing, pale appearance and the poet's own feelings of pain and fear associated with decline. 👧👦🎉🏡

4.  **Why has the mother been compared to the ‘late winter’s moon’?**
    The mother is compared to a 'late winter’s moon' because her face looks **wan** (colourless) and **pale**. A winter moon is often seen as hazy or obscure, lacking brightness and strength, which symbolises the mother's **diminishing health and vitality** as she ages, hinting at the closeness of the end. 👵🌙☁️

5.  **What do the parting words of the poet and her smile signify?**
    The parting words "see you soon, Amma" and the repeated smile signify the poet's conscious effort to **conceal her true feelings**. She is feeling pain and childhood fear about her mother's condition, but she smiles to **reassure her mother and herself**. It's a way to mask the underlying anxiety and sorrow, expressing hope for a future meeting despite the visible signs of ageing. 😊👋 hiding 😥.
