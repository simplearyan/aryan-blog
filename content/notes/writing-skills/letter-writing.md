Letter writing is presented as an **important way to communicate with people who are far away**.

There are generally **two main types of letters**:

1.  **Formal Letters** 🏢📬: These are written for **official business and information**. You'd use them when writing to public bodies or agencies for things you need in civic life, like asking for a certificate or updating your address. A letter is often part of a series of exchanges.
2.  **Informal Letters** 💌😊: These are **personal letters to communicate with friends and family**.

**How to Write Formal Letters (Steps)** 📝➡️🏢:

The sources outline these steps:
*   **Introduce yourself** if it's your first time writing, or **refer to an earlier letter** if you're replying.
*   **State the purpose of the letter** clearly.
*   State the **action or information you need** from the person you're writing to, or explain the action you've taken or information you're providing.
*   You might **urge action to be taken** or **offer future assistance**.

**Important things to keep in mind** when writing a letter:

*   Your **Purpose** 🎯
*   The **Person you are addressing** 👤
*   The **Tone** you should use 🗣️
*   **Completeness** of your message ✅
*   The **Action required** ➡️
*   **Conciseness** of your expression ✨

**Format of a Formal Letter** 📜🏢:

Letters have a typical format:
*   **Name and address of the sender** (often on a letterhead for companies).
*   **Name and address of the addressee** (the person you're writing to).
*   **Date** 🗓️.
*   **Salutation** (how you address the person). This can be:
    *   'Dear Sir/Madam' for a total stranger.
    *   'Dear Mr/Ms/Dr/Professor + Surname' for a formal relationship.
    *   'Dear [First Name]' if you know them personally and it's semi-formal.
*   A **subject line** is often included above the salutation for quick reference.
*   The **Content** goes in paragraphs.
*   A **Complimentary close** (like 'Thank you', 'With regards', 'Yours sincerely/truly') is used to end politely.
*   Your **Signature** goes below the complimentary close.

The sources note that nowadays, in the **Full-Block style**, all parts of the letter are **aligned on the left**.

**Tips for Formal Letters** ✅🙅‍♀️:

*   **Date and signature are very important**.
*   **Don't use commas after every line in the address**.
*   Avoid old-fashioned openings like "With reference to your letter dated...". Use more personalised phrases.
*   **Never end with "Thanking you" or "Awaiting your reply"**. Instead, write "Thank you" or "We/I await/look forward to your reply".

**Informal Letters** 😊💌:
These have a **flexible format**. You might just put your city and the date at the top, followed by a simple salutation like 'Dear Sujata,'. The closing is also more personal, like 'Bye,' 'With love,' etc..

**Job Application** 📄📬:

A job application often includes a **resume** (also called curriculum vitae or biodata), which is a summary of your background, qualifications, experience, etc.. This is sent with a **covering letter**. The sources provide an example of a resume format and a covering letter explaining why you're applying and highlighting relevant skills.

So, letter writing is about choosing the right type (formal or informal), following a specific structure and format (especially for formal letters), and keeping your purpose and audience in mind to make your communication clear and effective! 😄✉️✨
