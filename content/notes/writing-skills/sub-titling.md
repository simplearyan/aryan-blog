Okay, let's look at how to do **Sub-titling**, pulling from the sources and keeping it easy to understand with emojis! 😄📝📍

Based on the sources, **Sub-titling** is a way to organise longer pieces of writing to help readers.

The **purpose of sub-titling** is to **convey the main idea or theme of each section** of a long piece of writing.

**Why do it?** 🤔💡
It helps the reader **know at a glance the sub-topics** that are being addressed in different parts of the text. Giving suitable sub-titles helps **break the monotony** of reading long passages.

**How to do it** (The main idea from the activity described) 🚶‍♀️➡️📝:
The core process involves:
1.  **Divide the article into sections**. This is based on the **shifts in the sub-topics** within the text. Look for where the focus changes slightly to a different aspect of the main theme.
2.  For each section you've identified, **give a suitable sub-heading** (or sub-title). This sub-heading should capture the main idea of *just that section*.

Think of it like putting mini-titles above different parts of a chapter in a book! 📚➡️📑

In short, you break down the text into its different parts (where the topic changes slightly) and give each part a clear, short title that tells the reader what that section is about. 😄📝✨
