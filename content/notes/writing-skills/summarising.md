Okay, let's break down how to do **Summarising**, drawing from the sources and keeping it easy to understand with emojis! 😄📝📚

**What is Summarising?** 🤔📖

Summarising **follows note-making**. While note-making is usually for your own personal reference, summarising is used **if the main points are to be reported**.

The purpose of summarising is the **selection and paraphrasing of all important information** from the original source. You do this by **analysing the paragraphs or passage** to plan your writing.

**How is it Done?** 🚶‍♀️➡️📝✨

The process involves steps similar to note-making:

1.  **Underlining important ideas**. ✨✍️
2.  **Writing them down**, often **abridging the verbs** initially, although you'll expand later. ✍️✂️

However, there are key differences and additions for summarising:

*   You should **avoid examples, explanations, and repetition**. 🚫🗣️🔁
*   Instead of just listing points in note form or nominalising (changing verbs to nouns) as in note-making, you **expand the points into full sentences**. ✍️➡️📜
*   You **link these sentences using suitable connectors**. 🔗➡️
*   You need to be **precise in your expression**. Using **one word for many** can help make it concise. For example, saying "Precocious children often turn out to be mediocre" instead of a longer sentence.
*   The summary will contain **all the main ideas** of the original.
*   A summary is **usually one-third the length** of the original passage.

Think of it as taking the skeleton of your notes and putting 'flesh' on it using concise, linked sentences, making sure you've captured the core message without the extra details! 😄💡✍️🤏
