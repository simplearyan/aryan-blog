Okay, here is an explanation of how to do note-making, based on the sources, made easy to understand with emojis! 😄📝✨

**What is Note-making?** 🤔📚

Note-making is described as an **important study skill** and something that helps you at work. It's about **drawing out the main points** from what you read. Why? Because it's **difficult to remember large chunks of information**.

**The Goal** 🎯💡

The main goal is to capture the **important information** from a text.

**How to Do It (Steps)** 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️➡️📝:

The sources suggest a process:

1.  **Underline** the important words and phrases in the original text. ✨✍️
2.  **Read the passage again**, actively **asking yourself questions** about the text (like "What is it about?", "Where is it found?", "What is its purpose?") and answering them as you go. 🤔❓✅
3.  Based on your answers, **note down the main points**. When you do this, **write the points without the full forms of verbs**. ✍️✂️
4.  You can **combine related ideas** into one point. 🔗💡💡=💡
5.  Organise your points. Go over the facts and **number them**. You can use numbering (1, 2, 3...) and sub-numbering ((i), (ii)... or (a), (b)...) or a 'decimal' system (1, 1.1, 1.1.1...). 🗺️🔢
6.  You can also **change verbs to nouns** and start points with them, and **group related points**. 🧠🏗️

**Characteristics of Good Notes** ✅🏆:

Good notes have certain features:

*   They should be **short**. 📏
*   They should **identify the main point**. 💡🎯
*   They list information in what is called **'note form'**. 📝✨
*   They are written **only in phrases**, not full sentences. ✍️❌sentence
*   Information is **logically divided and subdivided** using figures/letters. 🏗️🔢
*   **Abbreviations and symbols** are used freely. & 👍
*   **Articles, prepositions, and conjunctions are omitted**. 🚫 The, in, and
*   Most importantly, notes **must make sense when read again**. If not, they are of no use! 🤔✅👍

So, note-making is about getting the essential information down in a structured, shortened format using your own understanding and abbreviations, so it's useful for you later! 😄📝💡🧠
